## Professional Duties

### Analyse

The analysis process starts by understanding how developers and designers currently engage with the design system. This involves mapping out their workflows, identifying any bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or areas where improvements can be made. By creating visual diagrams of these processes such as flowcharts, it becomes easier to understand the order of tasks, dependencies, and handoffs between team members. During this analysis, particular attention is paid to identifying pain points or challenges faced by developers and designers in their day-to-day work. These could include issues such as delays in accessing design assets, inconsistencies in design specifications, or difficulties in collaboration between team members.
Simultaneously, it's essential to define specific metrics that will be tracked on the dashboard. These metrics should be carefully chosen to provide meaningful insights into the usage of the design system. Examples include component adoption rates and developer feedback on their technical feasibility and versatility.
Once the data sources have been identified and the metrics defined, the collected data is analysed to gain deeper insights into how developers are using the design system. This analysis involves finding trends, and any areas that may require optimisation. By understanding how developers interact with the system and how they use its components, insights can be gained to inform decisions aimed at improving the overall design system and developer productivity.

### Advise

With the previous analysis, use UCD Techniques to identify possible future additions to the project that can be made. Give recommendations for where the project should not go, so as to not deviate from the project goals. Analyse upcoming technology trends that might benefit this project.

### Design

Translate recommendations into tangible user interactions using Figma. Design usability tests to identify interaction problems and assess user experience. Apply standard interaction design processes, incorporating UCD principles throughout. Develop detailed UX designs tailored to project phases, focusing on visual hierarchy and usability. Consider long-term client strategy and organisational goals to align the dashboard design with business objectives. Anticipate societal trends and technological developments to future-proof the dashboard's effectiveness.

### Realise

During the realization phase, I'll build the dashboard using Nuxt 3. I'll implement the interactive design, ensuring it meets accessibility standards and design guidelines. Usability tests will validate its effectiveness, conducted both in the field and in controlled environments. Throughout the project, I'll focus on developing and testing the user experience, aiming for seamless integration of design and functionality. Additionally, I'll future-proof the dashboard with innovative UX elements and standards, aligning with stakeholders' vision and strategy.
