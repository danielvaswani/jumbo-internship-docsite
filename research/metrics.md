# Design Systems

[[toc]]

This Literature study will focus on the following research question:

_How might we best automate the reporting to Kompas stakeholders about key success metrics about its usage between designers and
developers that use it?_

In particular the subquestion that has to be tackled, is:

## What are all the metrics used to gauge DS success?

In order to understand what makes Kompas successful we have to find metrics that accurately showcase the success of a Design System. This gives stakeholders of the dashboard an overview of the areas of improvement to facilitate better collaboration between designers and developers.

Currently this is as far as KPI tracking goes at Jumbo for Kompas. There is a spreadsheet that manually updated every couple months irregularly. This is not desirable as very often it does not represent the truth of the current state of Kompas, wheather its about the components or Design tokens. No other aspects of Kompas are being tracked to see if they meet standards set by the main stakeholders.

### How do we choose from them?

We should do a to find out what metrics are most important to the stakeholders of Kompas.

### Conclusion

The metrics we will use are Consistency, Adoption, Efficiency, and Satisfaction.
Now that we have our main metrics on our dashboard we can now brainstorm on possible graphs and insights, visualizations that can be made from the data.

We need to be able to present the data in an insightful and understandable way.
